your quote will look like this:



<div class="quotes">
    <div class="quote-container">
        <p>
        The many lives lost during long years of conflict... because of those selfless sacrifices, we are able to bathe in peace and prosperity now. To ingrain this history within the new generation will be a vital cog in helping to maintain the peace.
        </p>
        <p>Naruto Uzumaki(Boruto: Naruto Next Generations)</p>
        <button class="del-button">Delete</button>
    </div>
    <!-- other quotes -->
</div>


- Be careful about class/ id names. The css will not kick in otherwise

Tasks:
1) Display all quotes in the `quotes` div
2) Build out the delete button
3) Form should be able to add quotes to list on the dom and the array `data`
4) Bonus: The `random quote` button should display a random quote in the pTag. If the quote is liked, it should add to the dom and the `data` array
5) **Bonus**: Make sure the form only submits if all fields are field. Otherwise it displays an error asking the user to fill out all fields
